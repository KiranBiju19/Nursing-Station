# Java OOP Application using Swing

## Project Overview
This project is a **Java-based application** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI). The project demonstrates how to design and implement a user-friendly application using core OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Key Features
- **GUI Implementation**: Designed an interactive interface using Java Swing, which includes buttons, menus, and forms for user interaction.
- **OOP Principles**: Leveraged Javaâ€™s OOP features to structure the application effectively:
  - **Classes and Objects**: Modeled real-world entities as classes and created objects to handle application functionality.
  - **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Implemented class hierarchies to promote code reuse and flexibility.
  - **Encapsulation**: Used access modifiers to restrict access to class members, promoting data security and integrity.
  
## Tools and Technologies
- **Java Swing** for GUI design
- **Java SE** for core programming and application logic

**I did this project with my friends as a part of micro project in college. 
The video attached to this code will help you understand how the code works.
Please do ensure that all the files are present in same folder before running. Hope this may be helpful for you :)**
