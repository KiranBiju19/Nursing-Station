# Java OOP Application using Swing

## Project Overview
This project is a **Java-based application** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI). The project demonstrates how to design and implement a user-friendly application using core OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Key Features
- **GUI Implementation**: Designed an interactive interface using Java Swing, which includes buttons, menus, and forms for user interaction.
- **OOP Principles**: Leveraged Java’s OOP features to structure the application effectively:
  - **Classes and Objects**: Modeled real-world entities as classes and created objects to handle application functionality.
  - **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Implemented class hierarchies to promote code reuse and flexibility.
  - **Encapsulation**: Used access modifiers to restrict access to class members, promoting data security and integrity.
  
## Tools and Technologies
- **Java Swing** for GUI design
- **Java SE** for core programming and application logic
